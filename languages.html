        <p>Below is the list of programming languages I am focusing on learning, developing, and sharpening at this time.</p>

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>The life of a webpage. Without JavaScript, the only interaction people could have with the internet is to click to go to different pages and send information on forms. There would be no way to adjust content on the screen once it is loaded into view based on interactions on the page - additional pages would need to be created to be downloaded by the user to adjust to the new information. Animation and changing visual states of various items on a web page would be extremely limited - CSS animation options take effect once loaded or on very specific actions (and only on the item that the action happened to). JavaScript is what promotes interactivity with users. It can be used so a user can click a checkbox along the bottom of the screen, and it triggers an animation on a different item at the top of the page. It can keep track of what visual state each item is supposed to be based on actions that occured after the page loaded. JavaScript is also able to take information in a condensed format and build entirely new page views based on that data - after a web server sends the initial page and script to a web browser, the server no longer has to be concerned with or communicate how a page should be laid out. Several pages within a website have common items - with JavaScript, the template with all those common items stay in place while the unneeded content is taken out and replaced with new information, meaning the server only needs to supply the updated data users spend less time waiting for pages to load. The combination of the above uses and many more leads to endless possibilities for websites.</p>

                <p>The above benefits for making websites interactive and engaging (as well as the ability to create web servers, mobile applications, and desktop applications with NodeJS) make JavaScript the critical language for me to sharpen and grow most efficient in. The popularity and need for JavaScript also led to the creation of several frameworks, including <img src="images/react.svg" alt="React Icon">React and <img src="images/vue.svg" alt="React Icon">VueJS, to speed up development and organize code and layout information in a cleaner matter.</p>
