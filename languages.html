        <h1>Programming Language Goals and Focus</h1>
        <p>Below is the list of programming languages I am focusing on learning, developing, and sharpening at this time.</p>
        <div class="pic-item">
            <img src="images/js.svg" alt="Javascript Logo">
            <div class="pic-text">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>The life of a webpage. Without JavaScript, the only interaction people could have with the internet is to click to go to different pages and send information on forms. There would be no way to adjust content on the screen once it is loaded into view based on interactions on the page - additional pages would need to be created to be downloaded by the user to adjust to the new information. Animation and changing visual states of various items on a web page would be extremely limited - CSS animation options take effect once loaded or on very specific actions (and only on the item that the action happened to). JavaScript is what promotes interactivity with users. It can be used so a user can click a checkbox along the bottom of the screen, and it triggers an animation on a different item at the top of the page. It can keep track of what visual state each item is supposed to be based on actions that occured after the page loaded. JavaScript is also able to take information in a condensed format and build entirely new page views based on that data - after a web server sends the initial page and script to a web browser, the server no longer has to be concerned with or communicate how a page should be laid out. Several pages within a website have common items - with JavaScript, the template with all those common items stay in place while the unneeded content is taken out and replaced with new information, meaning the server only needs to supply the updated data users spend less time waiting for pages to load. The combination of the above uses and many more leads to endless possibilities for websites.</p>

                <p>The above benefits for making websites interactive and engaging (as well as the ability to create web servers, mobile applications, and desktop applications with NodeJS) make JavaScript the critical language for me to sharpen and grow most efficient in. The popularity and need for JavaScript also led to the creation of several frameworks, including <img src="images/react.svg" alt="React Icon">React and <img src="images/vue.svg" alt="React Icon">VueJS, to speed up development and organize code and layout information in a cleaner matter.</p>

        <div class="pic-item">
            <img src="images/css3.svg" alt="CSS3 Logo">
            <div class="pic-text">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>The style and dressing of a webpage. The HTML provides the skeleton or structure, and content of a webpage, but it leaves the browser to decide how to dress or style the page. CSS provides a set of instructions and directions on how to dress up the HTML. HTML is capable of accepting styling statements in its structure as well, however it will be limited that specific page or element. External CSS stylesheets allow us to write style definitions once and apply that to every page on the website. CSS can be used to animate different elements now: on its own, the start time of each animation is limited to once the element loads - but combined with JavaScript to adjust when these animations start, a lot of powerful and enticing imagery can be created.</p>
                <p>CSS is a critical learn for me because the visuals are the first opportunity to draw in the user's eye. It is within the first few seconds a user will make that quick glance to determine if the site has the information or products needed or desired. It works closely with previous graphic design training I've had in the past where we focus on organizing information to draw the eye to where it needs to go.</p>

        <div class="pic-item">
            <img src="images/nodejs.svg" alt="NodeJS Logo">
            <div class="pic-text">                
                <h2>Node.js</h2>
                <p>JavaScript, but outside the browser. The introduction of this runtime engine means servers could now also be coded using JavaScript, rather than PHP or ASP.NET. Not every backend application behind a website needs the same amount of computational power to compile data to send back to the browser. A full-stack developer now only needs to know one programming language and all its rules and quirks in order to develop a complete website. A backend written in JavaScript through Node.js is going to be more than capable to handle a majority of use cases and needs. It shines in the number of concurrent connections it can handle at once - one of the motivations behind Node.js's creation.</p>
                <p>Sharpening my skills with Node.js pattern and libraries and applications makes the most sense for me for full stack web development. Using one set of syntactic rules and keywords allows for the most rapid development for a web application as a whole. There are even libraries avaiable for Node.js to be utilized to create desktop and mobile applications for a one-langauge-fits-all approach to launching clients for multiple platforms at once to connect to the same backend.</p>

        <div class="pic-item">
            <img src="images/python.svg" alt="Python Logo">
            <div class="pic-text">                
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>Data Science and automated tasks. Python is most popular in the realm of data science, gathering larges amounts of input and processing it through statistical forumlas and other mathematical operations to create projections of future activities like expected sales, or predict patterns in society and purchases. It can also be used to quickly automate repetitive tasks. As an example, I have 100 pictures that are current sized at 1920x1080 pixels, but I need them to be 640x360 pixels for an album. I could open each picture in Photoshop or GIMP resize the picture then save at a new location one by one. With the Python library <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pillow</a>, I could write the code to resize every picture and have every picture resized in far less time than I could manually resize 10 of those pictures. One of the first Discord bots I've (sloppily) written was also in Python, and after taking in a command, would reach out a game randomizer website to generate a game seed, and a patch file for the seed, then send messages to relevant players as part of a gaming tournament.</p>
                <p>It can also be used to create the backend of a web server, utilizing libraries like Django and Flask. While backend libraries like Django or ExpressJS are primarily responsible for handling database operations and storing input from users and other sources, these libraries are also with compatible with various templating engines - they can take a base set of HTML, and insert data dynamically before sending a custom HTML page to the browser. The browser will think that there are far more pages avaiable than have been actually created. Sometimes after a backend with templating system created, it is decided that it would be better to convert to an API model that just sends the data rather than all HTML structure. It is oftentimes not worth rewriting an entire system into a different programming language to accomplish purposes unless there are extreme bugs that will be cost a lot of time to fix first.</p>

            <img src="images/c-sharp.svg" alt="C# Logo">
            <div class="pic-text">                
                <h2>C#</h2>
                <p>Power and Speed and Ease. C# can be used to create applications for several devices and purposes: websites, cloud services, desktop applications, mobile applications, and games to name a few. The Unity Game Engine utilizes C# to store logic and game behaviors. While game development is not a current long-term goal professionally for me, learning some game design in Unity will help think through more design approaches that can be brought towards designing in NodeJS. C# is also incredibly beneficial for whenever there is a backend application that require computationally heavy tasks and calculations, such as large scale tournament bracket generation or randomization of several elements with a lot of restraints.</p>
